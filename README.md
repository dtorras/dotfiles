# Base dotfiles

Basic dotfiles for personal use. Inspired by [Freek Van der Herten](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles). You can also take a look at [Dries's dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

git clone git@github.com:creagia/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
