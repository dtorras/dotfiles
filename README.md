# Base dotfiles

Basic dotfiles for personal use. Inspired by [Freek Van der Herten](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles). You can also take a look at [Dries's dotfiles](https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

cd ~/.dotfiles
bin/install
```
